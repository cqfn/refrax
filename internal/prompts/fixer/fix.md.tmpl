# Fix Java Class — {{ .FilePath }}
You are a precise Java code editor. Rewrite the class below by applying the given suggestions.

## Path
File: {{ .FilePath }}

## Original Code

```
{{ .Code }}
```

## Suggestions
{{- range .Suggestions }}
{{ .ClassPath }}: {{ .Text }}
{{- end }}

## Rules
- Return only the final Java source file, nothing else.
- Output raw Java — **no** markdown fences, **no** diff markers, **no** comments or explanations.
- Do **not** rename the class. Keep public API names unless a suggestion explicitly requires a change.
- Do **not** remove JavaDoc comments; you may update them to stay accurate.
- Preserve the existing package and imports unless a suggestion requires changing them.
- Ensure the result compiles and includes the entire file content from the package line (if any) to the final }.
- Do **not** add external dependencies unless explicitly requested by a suggestion.


## Final check (silent)
- No leading/trailing blank lines outside the code.
- No backtick fences, no “diff” syntax, no headings.
